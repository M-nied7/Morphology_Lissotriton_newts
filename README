elongationloop.apm - for elongation measurement of each photo
feretmax.apm - the longest - measurement of maximum Feret diameter of the object used for tail tip measurement
shape_measurements_loop.apm - measurement of elongation of the newt shape
spots_loop.apm - recognition and measurements of the spots (estimation of the shape of the objects via circularity and elongation)
tail_tips.apm - visualization of tail tip only
